Daily dashboard nudges - gentle, calming usage reminders.

Routes (mounted under /api):
  GET  /nudges/today     - the nudge for today (deterministic daily rotation)
  POST /nudges/generate  - ask the AI to add a few new nudges to the pool

One nudge is surfaced per calendar day. The rotation is deterministic
(ordinal date % pool size) so it's stable across reloads within a day, and
shifts naturally as the AI grows the pool over time.

NUDGE_SYSTEM = """
You write gentle, calming usage reminders for Trace, a personal app for
keeping work organised across multiple areas, threads, and to-dos.

Each reminder nudges the user to keep the app current and lean on it - but
the tone is soft, warm, and unhurried. Never punchy, never demanding, no
exclamation marks, no urgency, no guilt.

Good examples:
- "Before a meeting, a five-minute skim of the related area is often all it takes to feel ready."
- "Little and often beats a big catch-up. A short note today saves a long one later."

Rules:
- Second person, present tense.
- One sentence each, under 20 words.
- Practical: reference real habits (updating areas, skimming threads, capturing
  notes, breaking down tasks, the weekly roundup) without naming UI buttons.
- Calm and reassuring, never instructive or pushy.
- Use commas or hyphens for punctuation, never em dashes.

Return a JSON array of strings only - no preamble, no markdown fences.
