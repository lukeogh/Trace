# Microsoft 365 — Azure app registration (one-time setup)

Before Trace can read your Outlook calendar, you need to register a small
Azure application — it's free, takes about 5 minutes, and only has to be
done once. Microsoft requires this as the security boundary: **you** decide
what app talks to your data, and Trace's Settings → Integrations → Microsoft
365 only ever sees the app credentials *you* paste in.

## What you'll end up with

Three values:
1. **Client ID** — a GUID identifying your Azure app
2. **Client secret** — a password for your Azure app (Trace stores it Fernet-encrypted)
3. **Tenant** — usually `common` (lets you sign in with personal or work accounts)

Paste those three into Settings → Integrations → Microsoft 365 in Trace, then click "Sign in with Microsoft." That's it.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open the Azure portal

Go to **[https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)** and sign in
with your Microsoft account (personal or work). If you've never done this,
Azure will walk you through creating a free subscription — no credit card
required for app registrations.

### 2. Navigate to App registrations

In the top search bar, type **"App registrations"** and click it. Then
click **+ New registration** at the top of the page.

### 3. Fill in the registration form

- **Name:** anything memorable. `Trace - personal` is fine.

- **Supported account types:** pick the option that matches who will sign in:
  - **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** — most flexible. Use this if you want both personal and work accounts to work.
  - **Accounts in this organizational directory only** — work account only, single tenant.

  *(Trace's `tenant_id` field maps to your choice: `common` for the
  flexible option, your tenant GUID for single-tenant.)*

- **Redirect URI:** under "Web", paste:

  ```
  http://localhost:8000/api/microsoft/auth/callback
  ```

  *(That's the loopback URL Trace's backend listens on. If you've changed
  Trace's backend port, swap `8000` for yours.)*

- Click **Register**.

### 4. Copy the Client ID

You'll land on the app's Overview page. Under **Essentials**, find
**Application (client) ID** — it's a GUID that looks like
`a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab`. **Copy it.** This is your
`Client ID`.

If you chose single-tenant, also copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** GUID
right below — that's your `Tenant` value. (If you chose the flexible
option, your tenant is just the word `common`.)

### 5. Create a Client Secret

In the left sidebar, click **Certificates & secrets** → **Client secrets**
tab → **+ New client secret**.

- **Description:** `Trace`
- **Expires:** pick a duration. Azure recommends 6 months for production
  apps; 24 months is fine for personal use. Whatever you pick, set a
  calendar reminder for a week before expiry — Trace will stop syncing
  silently when the secret expires.

Click **Add**. **Immediately copy the `Value`** (not the `Secret ID`). The
Value is shown ONCE and never again — if you navigate away without copying,
you'll need to create a new one.

That's your `Client Secret`.

### 6. Grant the API permissions

In the left sidebar, click **API permissions** → **+ Add a permission** →
**Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**.

Search for and tick each of:
- `Calendars.Read`  *(read your Outlook calendar)*
- `User.Read`  *(read your basic profile - Graph requires this for every app)*
- `offline_access`  *(let Trace refresh your token without re-signing-in)*

Click **Add permissions**.

You should see all three listed under "Configured permissions" with green
ticks. **No admin consent is needed for personal use** — these are all
delegated, user-consent permissions. Trace will ask for them when you sign
in.

### 7. Paste into Trace

Back in Trace:

1. Open **Settings → Integrations → Microsoft 365**
2. Paste the three values from steps 4 and 5
3. Click **Save config**
4. Click **Sign in with Microsoft** — your system browser opens
5. Sign in with your Microsoft account, consent to the permissions
6. The Trace settings page flips to "Connected as <you@example.com>"

The first calendar sync runs immediately. After that, the scheduler does
a fresh pull every 30 minutes; you can also force one with the **Sync
now** button.

## Troubleshooting

**"AADSTS50011: redirect URI mismatch"** — the URI in step 3 must match
*exactly*, including the protocol (`http://`, not `https://`) and port.
Edit it under Authentication in the Azure portal if you got it wrong.

**"invalid_client" during token exchange** — you copied the Secret ID
instead of the Secret Value. Go back to Certificates & secrets and copy
the Value column. (If your secret has expired, you'll need to create a
new one.)

**Sync runs but no signals appear** — open Trace's Signals page and click
"Sync now". Check the timestamp on Settings → Integrations → Microsoft 365
to confirm the last sync went through. If it shows an old time, your
token may have expired silently — disconnect and reconnect.

**"AADSTS70008: refresh token expired"** — happens roughly every 90 days
of inactivity. Disconnect and reconnect in Trace's Microsoft 365 settings.

## Privacy & permissions notes

- Trace only ever reads. There is no scope in the request list that allows
  write access to your calendar, mail, files, or anything else.
- The scopes requested are exactly the three above. You can audit them at
  any time in your Microsoft account at
  [account.live.com → Privacy → Apps and services](https://account.live.com)
  (personal account) or your work admin's access panel (work account).
- Your access + refresh tokens are stored Fernet-encrypted in Trace's
  local SQLite database. If your laptop is lost and you don't have full
  disk encryption, treat that database the same as your password manager.
- To revoke Trace's access entirely: disconnect inside Trace, then revoke
  the app's consent in your Microsoft account at the URL above.
