# Trace.

> Stay across everything.

A self-hosted department activity tracker for the Axithra software team. Tracks the current situation across seven software disciplines — Documentation, Firmware, Software Test, Software Development, Algorithm, Design, and Security — with named threads and chronological log entries per thread.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine + Docker Compose installed
- Git installed
- Port `8080` free on your machine

### Run with Docker

```bash
# Clone your repo (or navigate to the project directory)
cd department-log

# Build and start the container
docker compose up --build -d

# The app is now available at:
# http://localhost:8080
```

On first run, the database is created automatically and the seven areas are seeded. All data persists in the `./data/` directory.

### Stop the container

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Rebuild after code changes

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Development (without Docker)

For local development you run the backend and frontend separately, with Vite proxying API calls to FastAPI.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the data directory
mkdir -p ../data/uploads

# Run the dev server
DB_PATH=../data/department.db UPLOAD_DIR=../data/uploads uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

API is available at `http://localhost:8000`
Interactive API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite dev server (proxies /api → localhost:8000)
npm run dev
```

Frontend is available at `http://localhost:5173`

---

## API Reference

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/areas` | List all 7 areas with thread counts |
| GET | `/areas/:id` | Get a single area |
| PUT | `/areas/:id` | Update area status or summary |
| GET | `/areas/:id/threads` | List threads for an area |
| POST | `/areas/:id/threads` | Create a new thread |
| GET | `/threads/:id` | Get thread with all entries and attachments |
| PUT | `/threads/:id` | Update thread title, status, or description |
| DELETE | `/threads/:id` | Delete thread (cascades to entries and attachments) |
| POST | `/threads/:id/entries` | Add a log entry |
| PUT | `/entries/:id` | Edit an entry |
| DELETE | `/entries/:id` | Delete an entry |
| POST | `/threads/:id/attachments/file` | Upload a file (multipart) |
| POST | `/threads/:id/attachments/link` | Add a URL link |
| DELETE | `/attachments/:id` | Remove an attachment |

Uploaded files are served at `/uploads/:stored_name`.

---

## Data

All data lives in `./data/` and is never committed to git.

- `./data/department.db` — SQLite database. Back this up to preserve your records.
- `./data/uploads/` — Uploaded files. Include this in any backup.

**Backup:**
```bash
cp -r ./data ./data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

---

## Technology

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite | Fast, familiar, tree-shakeable |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 | Utility-first, dark mode via `class` |
| Routing | React Router v6 | Standard SPA routing |
| Icons | Lucide React | Consistent, lightweight |
| Markdown | react-markdown | Renders entry content |
| Dates | date-fns | Lightweight date formatting |
| Backend | Python FastAPI | Fast, typed, auto-generates API docs |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2 | Clean Python models, migrations-ready |
| Database | SQLite | Zero-config, single file, perfect at this scale |
| Container | Docker (multi-stage) | Reproducible builds; Node builds frontend, Python serves everything |

## Extending

This codebase is designed to be extended in future Claude sessions.
Start any extension session with:
> "Read README.md and REQUIREMENTS.md in the department-log project, then [your request]."

The `REQUIREMENTS.md` contains the full product specification.
